# Capstone_Project_3_2025

The intention of this project is to showcase the collected information from the csv files from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vesuvius13/serial-killers-dataset). My intentions are not to prove any particular idea true but to let the data unfold as I think it will but not writing it in any one direction. 

My kaggle set pulled several csv files and wrote code to clean it up and combine the files in a way that made it very easy to take in the information. 


Data requirements met-  read in several cvs files, cleaned and joined data using SQL and python to create columns and run data.
                        Created different charts and graphs 
                        Used Juypyter notebook, Seaborn, Matplotlib, pandas, numpy, pyplot, duckdb
                        25 commits


Created columns, headers, etc to bring all the csv files together into a single dataframe. Created tables, drop table options, etc 

Created various columns to include possible victims, confirmed victims while counting the records and then extracting the victims using pandas, columns added or will be added for victims possible because some of the killers weren't confirmed to stop at any one particular number. 


Split plots and graphs into different cells in juypyter file 

Graphs were written to cover information I thought was interesting to see for most people that might not have as much knowledge about serial killers as some others. 
I thought it was important to include the frequency, the average number of victims, number per year, count of victims per csv file, the information of possible victims, and the countries of serial killers ranked lowest to highest, finally the chart of all the varying qualifiers from year active, number of possible victims, etc. at a glance.  

The intention of this project was to showcase just how many sk's there are out in the world and have been over the years. I didn't want to let my bias on the information lead the project so I tried to write this to show the magnitude of loss at the hand of serial killers in the worlds history for people at a glance using my newly learned skills.
